            <p>Co-create a performance with professional artists based on your choice of theme.</p>
            <p>In this current season we are doing virtual video story based residencies as well as virtual classroom level theatre based residencies (no big show at the end). We are also doing in-school video story based residencies where possible.  </p>
            <p>For 2021-22 we expect to go back to our standard residency format of theatre based residencies with shows in the gym, as well as continuing to offer the other options
